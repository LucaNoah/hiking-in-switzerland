## Testing
---

- I tested that this page work in different browsers: Chrome Firefox & Microsoft Edge.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the DevTools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, discover, join us and contact text are all rideable and easy to understand.
- I confirmed that the form works. It requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

### Bugs

- Unsolved

In Chrome & Microsoft Edge, in the Discover section, no bullet points appear in the list. I tried to fix via list-style-type and used DevTools to check where it could come from, but no success. 

- Solved

I wanted the headings of the 3 divs (class: discover-switzerland-outer)I have aligned with display: inline-block; to appear in a horizontal line. Depending on how many lines the content of the paragraphs extends to, the headings appeared at different heights. I tried to fix this via min-height, but to no avail. In the end, vertical-align: top; solved the problem.

### Validator Testing

- HTML

The warning can be ignored, as no heading is required for this section.
